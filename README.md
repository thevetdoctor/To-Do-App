# To-Do-App
My to-do list application

 This application is designed to take in tasks by the user and log them on the page.
 
 It gives a welcome page where a click on the 'here' link takes you to a personalised browser-unique task list(local storage).
 
 The application is intended to display a reminder on the basis of priority of the different tasks( This aspect is still under production and inclusion).
 
 Individual tasks can be removed by a double-click of the mouse.
 
 The To-Do-App application is still a work in progress, so please watch out for more improvements.
 
 
 Application is developed by Me: Oderanti Obafemi @ Andela Bootcamp for Class X.
 
 Thank you.
